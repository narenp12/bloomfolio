I'm an aspiring statistician (hoping to get a PhD too) and lover of all things statistics. I was born and raised near Houston, Texas and lived there my entire life until going to college at UCLA.

My primary interests are sports and anything to do with information. My goal is to keep learning about these exciting fields (and really anything I can learn) for as long as I can.

This website is a fun little side thing for me to post about what I'm doing and just generally things I like!
